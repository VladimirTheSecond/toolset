# toolset
scripts for various needs

## clone_all_projects.sh
script will copy all projects from selected gitlab subgroup - useful when using gitlab community edition (without global search)

## check_conn.sh
give script a list of ip addresses as input - it will check each with ping, traceroute and telnet. Might be handy if you need to test a lot of instances to give logs for network support team.
